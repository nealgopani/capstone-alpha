To generate Alpha, our investment strategy entails:
* An exclusive focus on Enterprise Software firms
* Having ~10 long/short investments at any point in time. The benefits of diversification greatly diminish after 10 investments, and our ability to generate Alpha relies heavily on in-depth due diligence and the monitoring of each investment. 
* A typical investment horizon of 6 months to 3 years – Given the volatility in markets, valuations can change rapidly.  Hence, our exit time frame will match our target valuations and reflect developments.
* A heavy focus on mid-tier firms – We will have a “bell curve” approach to our investments, with the majority of the firms we choose in the mid-tier/large-tier range and market capitalizations of between $2 billion to $20 billion, and a few in the mega-cap or small cap ranges.
