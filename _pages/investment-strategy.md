To generate Alpha, our investment strategy entails:
* Exclusive focus on Enterprise Software firms
* Having ~ 10 long/short investments at any point in time - Benefits of
diversification greatly diminish after 10 investments, and our ability to generate
Alpha relies heavily on in-depth due diligence and monitoring of each
investment.
* Typical investment horizon of 6 months to 3 years – Given the volatility in
markets, valuations can change rapidly. Hence, our exit time-frame will match
our target valuations and reflect developments.
* Heavy focus on mid-tier firms – We will have a bar-bell approach with majority of
investments in mid-tier/large-tier firms with market capitalizations of between
$2billion to $20billion, and few in mega-cap or small cap.
