There is a wide range of relative valuations within the enterprise software space. In fact, the gap between two extremes is wider now than ever before (ranging from 1x to 50x LTM revenues).  We consider the following when formulating our long/short investment thesis for specific stocks:

* Competitive Advantage / Competitive Moat – How sustainable is a firm’s competitive advantage, and how will it evolve within the next 12 months?
* Network Effect / Domino Effect – Is a firm taking advantage of channel partnerships (add something here), marquee account wins to penetrate sub-industries or supply chains, or ecosystems to generate “Domino Effects” for growth? Some firms have more linear growth profiles, and others have more exponential ones due to vast differences in their affinity to the “Network Effect.”  This can have a huge impact on capital efficiency for driving growth, and hence valuations.
* Clarity of Value Proposition – Often the key to success resides with having a very clear value proposition for clients.  Firms that have very broad offerings and/or whose value propositions are difficult to understand get penalized by investors with lower valuations.
* Growth rate in revenues – Often firms, especially software enterprise firms, embark on the “land and expand” strategy (get a toehold into clients with a small offering, and then expand offerings after then), which generates cash flows that are negative during the aggressive expansion phase.  Given this, the growth rate in revenues becomes a big driver of valuations and impact our investment thesis.
* Gross Margin percentage – We believe that gross margin percentages of 70% or more reflect the business models with the highest competitive advantage within the enterprise software space.  Lower gross margin percentages typically reflect higher services revenues, higher channel costs for revenue sharing, or weaker competitive position.         
* SaaS versus Nonrecurring Revenues – In today’s cloud-based economy, revenue models that are nonrecurring face an uphill battle for not just growth and margins, but also for gaining access to capital for accelerating growth.  Hence the gap in valuation is tremendous between SaaS firms and those that have nonrecurring revenues.
* Size of Total Addressable Market (TAM) – Verticalized firms with niche offerings have a narrower TAM, in contrast to horizontal firms with broader offerings.  Size of TAM relative to a firm’s competitive position provides a guidepost for future growth prospects, and hence valuation multiples.
* Track record of Management – Often this is the single most important variable for generating Alpha.  Great management teams anticipate growing problems and are much more proactive than reactive.  They are transparent about issues and promote a culture of high ethics and integrity.
* Acquisition Potential – M&A activity in the enterprise software sector is prolific; most of our long investments will have a core thesis for takeout potential.
* Strength of Balance Sheet – The combination of high debt and negative EBITDA often create toxic situations and hence short opportunities arise.  The opposite is true for the long thesis.
