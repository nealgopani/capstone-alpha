There is a wide range of relative valuations within the enterprise software space. In fact, the
gap between two extremes is wider now than ever before (ranging from of 2x to 50x LTM
revenues). We take into account the following when formulating our long/short investment
thesis for specific stocks:

* Competitive Advantage / Competitive Moat – How sustainable is a firm’s competitive
advantage, and how will it evolve within next 12 months?
* Network Effect / Domino Effect – Is a firm taking advantage of channel partnerships,
marquee account wins to penetrate sub-industries or supply chains, or eco-systems to
generate domino effects for growth? Some firms have more linear growth profiles, and
others have exponential ones due to vast differences in “Network effect.” This can
have a huge impact on capital efficiency for driving growth, and hence valuations.

* Clarity of Value Proposition – Often the key to success resides with having a very clear
value proposition for clients. Firm’s which have very broad offerings and whose value
proposition is not easy to understand get penalized by investors with lower valuations.
* Growth rate in revenues – Often firm’s embark on strategy to “land and expand” (get a
toehold into clients with a small offering, and then expand offerings after then) which
generate cashflows that are negative during aggressive expansion phase. Given this,
the growth rate in revenues becomes a big driver of valuations and impact our
investment thesis.
* Gross Margin percentage – We believe that gross margin percentage of 70% of more
reflect the most promising business models with highest competitive advantage within
the enterprise software space. Lower gross margin percentage typically reflect higher
services revenues, higher channel costs for revenue sharing, or weaker competitive
position.
* SaaS versus Non-recurring revenues – In today’s cloud-based economy, revenue
models that are non-recurring face an uphill battle for not just growth and margins, but
also for gaining access to capital for accelerating growth. Hence the gap in valuation is
tremendous between SaaS firms and those that have non-recurring revenues.
* Size of Total Addressable Market (TAM) – Verticalized firms with niche offerings have
narrower TAM, versus horizontal firms with broader offerings. Size of TAM relative to
a firm’s competitive position provides guide-post for future growth prospects, and
hence valuation multiples.
* Track record of Management – Often this is the single most important variable for
generating Alpha. Great management teams anticipate growing problems, and are
proactive more so than reactive. They are transparent about issues, and promote a
culture of high ethics and integrity.
* Acquisition Potential – M&amp;A activity in enterprise software sector is prolific; most of
our long investments will have a core thesis for take-out potential.
* Strength of Balance Sheet – Combination of high debt and negative EBITDA often
create toxic situations and hence create Short opportunities. The opposite is true for
Long thesis.
