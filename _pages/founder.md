Deep Gopani founded Capstone Alpha Partners (“CAP”) while attending High Technology High School, which has been the nation’s highest ranked STEM high school for the past 5 consecutive years.  His core belief has always been that specialization is a prerequisite for extraordinary outcomes.  Thus, he started CAP in 2019 as an Enterprise Software focused fund after doing research for the prior 2 years.  He gained insights from publications of numerous legends such as Peter Lynch, Barton Biggs, and Ray Dalio, as well as Wharton Alumni who specialize in Information Technology investments.  Deep is a competitive fencer who believes that emotions are a hindrance in a match; he applies the same corollary to running CAP without emotional biases.
