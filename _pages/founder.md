Deep Gopani founded Capstone Alpha Partners (“CAP”) while attending High Technology High
School, which has been the nation’s highest ranked STEM high school for the past 5 consecutive
years. His core belief has always been that specialization is a pre-requisite for extraordinary
outcomes. Thus, he started CAP in 2019 as an Enterprise Software focused fund after gaining
valuable experience from DSP Investment Managers (one of the largest asset managers in India
which had JV with Blackrock). He also gained insights from publications of numerous legends
such as Peter Lynch, Barton Biggs, and Ray Dalio, as well Wharton Alumni who specialize in
Information Technology investments. Deep is a competitor fencer who believes that emotions
should be contained while fighting; he applies the same corollary to running CAP without
emotional biases.
