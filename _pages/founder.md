Deep Gopani founded Capstone Alpha Partners (“CAP”) while attending High Technology High
School, which has been the nation’s highest ranked STEM high school for the past 5 consecutive
years according to U.S. News. In his sophomore year, Deep worked at DSP Investment
Managers (a leading asset management firm in Asia managing over 200 mutual funds, which
had a JV with Blackrock) as an Investment Research intern. There, he gained valuable
experience for both macro/sector level research, as well as fundamental research at the
company level. This DSP experience, in conjunction with his technology stocks research
experience during the past 2 years, empowered Deep to start CAP in 2019. He has gained
insights from publications of numerous legends such as Peter Lynch, Barton Biggs, and Ray
Dalio, as well as Wharton Alumni with experience in Information Technology investments.
Deep’s core belief has always been that specialization is a prerequisite for extraordinary
outcomes. CAP’s focus on Enterprise Software stocks within the larger Technology space is a
perfect match for his conviction and skills. Deep is a competitive fencer who believes that
emotions are a hindrance in a match; he applies the same corollary to running CAP with
strategic discipline and without emotional biases.
