title: Datadog and New Relic - An Opportune Time for a Pair Trade

Application and Performance Monitoring (APM) used to be a tiny niche in the Enterprise Software space. Not many companies had a need for software to help manage their other software; it used to be a “domain of techies” in the back office. However, that world has changed radically in recent years as dashboards guide C-level executives by providing visibility into their information technology infrastructures (everything ranging from servers in data centers to network and end applications). Thus, APM has now become critical for running modern enterprises.

New Relic (NEWR) is a SaaS cloud-based APM company. It specializes in the surveillance of applications particularly. Datadog (DDOG) is also a SaaS cloud-based APM company, but it specializes in infrastructure monitoring and metrics. Both of these companies have lots of overlap, but they aren’t head-on competitors since their offerings are differentiated. Nonetheless, there is now a brief window of time in which one can create alpha using a pair trade between these two APM firms.

Right now, DDOG is projected to grow revenues by 36% next year, from approximately $350 million to $475 million. By comparison, NEWR is only projected to grow revenues by about 18%, from $590 million to $700 million. This likely doesn’t come as a surprise, as DDOG just recently went public (on 8/24/19) and has lots more room to grow than NEWR, a company that has been around since 2014. This growth metric may make DDOG look like a compelling buy until one looks at the revenue multiples. Data Dog’s projected enterprise value to revenue multiple for next year is an astounding 24x (32x current year’s revenues), while New Relic’s is only 4.8x. Despite a much higher growth rate, DDOG’s relative valuation is clearly ludicrous.  

DDOG’s quarterly earnings release today showed 88% growth in revenues (year over year) with its stock jumping ~14% after hours to ~$39/share; its momentum is likely to reach peak levels soon as analysts present positive comments. However, this will then present an asymmetric risk/reward tradeoff in DDOG’s stock. Take Zscaler (ZS), for instance. After going public, its EV/R reached over 35x current year’s revenues (close to 32X that DDOG has), as investors disregarded how expensive the stock had become. Even though the company reported solid results, its momentum fizzled out later on and the stock crashed by nearly 50% to a more reasonable valuation. Something similar may happen to DDOG in the coming months after the spark of hype and interest from today’s earnings report subsides.

Based on the differences between DDOG and NEWR, an initiation of a short position on DDOG at a price above $39/share paired with a long on NEWR at price below $64/share may create alpha.
