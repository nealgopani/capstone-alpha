<h1>About Us</h1>

Capstone Alpha Partners is a specialized hedge fund focused on making investments in
Enterprise Software sector. Increasingly competitive advantage in modern economy is being
derived from extensive use of software which can drive efficiencies in every aspect of a firm’s
business. In fact, management of clients, suppliers, employees, regulators, manufacturing
processes and finances are now heavily dependent on sophisticated software. Advances in
Artificial Intelligence now allow businesses to integrate the most challenging aspects of
“unstructured data” and “tribal knowledge” into actionable processes.

Cloud computing and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business models have dramatically
transformed the value proposition of enterprise software firms. Historically, the cost of
deployment of software was high, and non-recurring revenue models greatly limited the
growth potential of firms. Now with high margins and more predictable revenue models, the
long-term cashflow visibility is also high, there-by supporting incredible valuations of emerging
players.

We believe that our focused investment strategy will allow us to generate Alpha, as enterprise
software becomes the crown jewel of our modern economy.
