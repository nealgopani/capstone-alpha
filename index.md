Capstone Alpha Partners is a specialized hedge fund focused on making investments in Enterprise Software sector. Increasingly competitive advantage in modern economy is being derived from extensive use of software which can drive efficiencies in every aspect of a firm’s business.  In fact, management of clients, suppliers, employees, regulators, manufacturing processes and finances are now heavily dependent on sophisticated software.  Advances in Artificial Intelligence now allow businesses to integrate the most challenging aspects of “unstructured data” and “tribal knowledge” into actionable processes.  

Cloud computing and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business models have dramatically transformed the value proposition of enterprise software firms.  Historically, the cost of deployment of software was high, and non-recurring revenue models greatly limited the growth potential of firms.  Now with high margins and more predictable revenue models, the long-term cashflow visibility is also high, there-by supporting incredible valuations of emerging players.

We believe that our focused investment strategy will allow us to generate Alpha, as enterprise software becomes the crown jewel of our modern economy.
